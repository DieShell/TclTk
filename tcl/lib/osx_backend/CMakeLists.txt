## Configuration ###############################################################
string(TIMESTAMP TCL_YEAR "%Y")
configure_file(src/Tcl-Info.plist.in
               Tcl-info.plist
               @ONLY
               )

configure_file(src/Tclsh-Info.plist.in

               )
# Note: TclTk CMake currently does not support generating MacOS Frameworks, thus
# the plist files are redundant. I however, have no idea how MacOS Frameworks
# work (= the reason there is no support for them), and how big of a deal they
# are to have, therefore, the files are left intact, are even configured but
# are unused. Feel free to implement the Framework support with them.
# Note on the note: CMake has built-in support for Frameworks, I just don't know
# what to do with it.
