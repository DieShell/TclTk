# Note: This header mimics the AutoTools checks done by Tcl and is no way a good
# way to handle configuration, because
# 1) even the official AutoTools docs say that most of these checks are 
# meaningless today, such as checking if string.h exists and contains memchr.
# This is even more utter nonsense, considering CMake itself probably wouldn't
# build on a system without a correct C89 string.h, even it CMake is C++;
# 2) because the Tcl build system doesn't correctly use a configured header file
# all flags are passed on the command line. This is not that big of a problem,
# considering modern systems are capable of handling long command line arguments,
# we still spam it with completely useless flags like HAVE_STRING_H which is 
# going to be true 99.9% of the cases.
