# TclTk

### Disclaimer

This Tcl distribution, if you can call it that, does not provide all the build functionality that the original Tcl
source distributions do: I see no chance of building Tcl on Ultrix, IRIX, AIX, OSF/1, VMS*, and other archaic/exotic
systems by using this project. (Even if the required system checks would be done correctly, whether CMake itself builds
on said platforms is most probably the tightest bottleneck.)

*: I do not know if Tcl by default builds on VMS or not. I know Perl5 does, so I guess Tcl does too?

## TclTk

This repository provides a CMake project for building Tcl (including core packages) and Tk.

Tcl/Tk is used by the optional GUI [DieShell/dsh](https://github.com/DieShell/dsh) provides and this project was born to
ease creating the installer for DieShell, by providing a homogenous CMake build environment for all DieShell and Tcl.

C and corresponding header sources are only minimally modified where include paths do not work properly with the
original relative include paths.

All AutoTools related build files are removed, with a few literally useless files which contain nothing;
Tcl's `threadUnix.c` file for example. (If I learn how to, I will send a patch about this latter change back to the Tcl
people.)

## CMake Targets

For use in other CMake projects, the following targets are defined for `target_link_libraries`.

- `tcl` The Tcl shared library
- `tclstub` The Tcl stub library
- `tk` The Tk shared library
- `tkstub` The Tk stub library

The `tclsh`, and `wish` executable targets may be used for custom commands that wish to rely on a fresh-baked Tcl
interpreter.
