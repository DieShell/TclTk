# testwrap.tcl --
#
# This file provides a wrapper around tktest to be run by CTest which (on Windows
# at least) cannot
#  - capture the output of tktest; OR
#  - apply a regular expression properly; OR
# tktest doesn't return the exit code with env(ERROR_ON_FAILURES).
# So this script is used to run the actual tktest executable, using the
# built tclsh executable.
#
# STDOUT
#   Prints the STDOUT from the invoked tktest as-is, without modifications.
#
# EXIT
#   Returns 0 for success and 1 for failures
