# Compatibility

- Provide pkg-config files in tcl.pc and tk.pc
- Provide standard {tcl,tk,tdbc}Config.sh, etc. files for finding out how
  to compile Tcl related stuffs

# Improvements

- A more sophisticated libm detection
- Put configuration into headers instead of passing everything on the command
  line. Note that there was an infant version of this in the original sources
  but it was just unused by most sources: I removed it to replace it later.
